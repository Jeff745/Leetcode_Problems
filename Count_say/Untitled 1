Implement a recursive approach

Parameters needed:
	-N, the current number we are processing
	
What is the base case?
	If 'n' =1
	-Return "1"
	
In each of the recursive call
	-Recursively find the 'prev' string for 'n-1'
	
	Create a Stringbuilder 'cur' to keep track of the count and say for 'n'
	
	Create a variable 'count' to keep track of the frequency of the current character
	
	Iterate through indices of 'prev', denoted as 'i'
		Increment 'count'
		If 'i' is at the last index or the Character at 'i+1' is not equal to the current character at 'i'
			-Append 'count' to 'cur'
			Append the current character to 'cur'
			Reset 'count' to 0
			
		Return a string representation of 'cur'
